    "# This helps to ensure that the object's state is not inadvertently modified by external code, \n",
    "# and provides a way to enforce the rules governing the object's behavior.\n",

    "# Inheritance: Inheritance allows one class to inherit the properties and methods of another class.\n",
    "# This is useful for creating hierarchies of classes with shared functionality,\n",
    "# and for creating specialized classes based on more general ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Polymorphism: Polymorphism refers to the ability of objects of different classes to be treated as if they were of the same class. \n",
    "# This allows for more flexible and modular code,\n",
    "# as different objects can be used interchangeably in the same context, as long as they conform to a common interface or protocol.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Abstraction: Abstraction is the practice of focusing on the essential properties and behavior of an object,\n",
    "# while ignoring its non-essential details.\n",
    "# This helps to simplify the design of complex systems, and makes it easier to reason about and modify code.\n",
