    "# The abc module in Python stands for \"Abstract Base Classes.\"\n",

    "# 1--Enforcing Abstract Base Classes (ABCs): \n",
    "#     The primary purpose of the abc module is to allow you to define and enforce abstract base classes.\n",
    "#     An abstract base class is a class that defines a common interface (a set of methods and attributes) \n",
    "#     that concrete subclasses must implement. By using the abc module, you can specify that certain methods \n",

    "# 2--Creating a Common Interface:\n",
    "#     Abstract base classes create a common interface that related classes should follow. \n",
    "#     This is crucial in object-oriented programming for creating a consistent and predictable design.\n",
    "#     When multiple classes share a common set of methods, you can treat them uniformly, \n",
    "#     leading to more maintainable and extendable code.\n",
    "# 3--Polymorphism and Duck Typing:\n",
    "#     Abstract base classes facilitate polymorphism, which means different classes can be treated\n",
    "#     as instances of a common base class. This enables you to write code that works with a variety of \n",
    "#     objects as long as they adhere to the common interface defined by the abstract base class.\n",

    "# 1--Define Abstract Data Types (ADTs): \n",
    "#     An abstract data type is a high-level specification of a data structure\n",

    "#     Define ADTs with clear interfaces, specifying the operations that can be performed on the data.\n",

    "# 2--Use Classes and Objects:\n",
    "#     In object-oriented programming, classes and objects are used to implement data abstraction.\n",
    "#     A class defines the structure and behavior of an abstract data type, \n",
    "#     while objects are instances of those classes that encapsulate data and methods to operate on that data.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 3--Encapsulation: \n",
    "#     Encapsulation is a key concept in achieving data abstraction. \n",

    "#     on the data into a single unit (class) and controlling access to the data through\n",

    "# 4--Access Control:\n",
    "#     In object-oriented languages like Python, you can use access control \n",
    "#     mechanisms to restrict direct access to an object's attributes.\n",
    "#     In Python, attributes can be designated as private by prefixing them with double underscores, \n",

    "\n",
    "# 5--Define Interfaces and Contracts:\n",
    "#     Specify clear and well-documented interfaces for your classes and abstract data types.\n",
    "#     Describe the methods and their expected behavior without revealing implementation details.\n",

    "\n",
    "# 4--Polymorphism:\n",

    "# 5--Abstract Classes and Methods: \n",
